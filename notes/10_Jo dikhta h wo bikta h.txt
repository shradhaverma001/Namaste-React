We will be using tailwind CSS.

TAILWIND CSSðŸš€

If u are using tailwind, parcel needs postcssrc to read tailwind.

To install TAILWIND use -
=> npm install -D tailwindcss postcss
=> npx tailwindcss init
- go to tailwind css on google and search for installation and follow the installation process.

and in tailwind.config.js file, modify the content field with the file extensions in which tailwind will be used.

PROS AND CONS OF TAILWIND CSSðŸš€
PROS -
1) No need to switch again and again between the files, like index.css and the js files, to declare a class and and goind to css file to write css.
2) It takes less memory, tailwind has a feature, that is only whatever css we have used, only that much will get build in the bundle together with the code and not the whole tailwind css bundle.
which makes it LIGHT WEIGHTED.

CONS -
1) Code may look bit dirty because we will be writing a lot of css, that will make code a bit ugly.
2) For me, - I personally found it bit less readable to understand, since with the classnames as container and then applying css, I found it more understandable.
