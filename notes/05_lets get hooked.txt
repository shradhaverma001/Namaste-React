FOLDER STRUCTURE
1) make folder for the components, name the component file as the name of the component(first letter capital).
2) always ensure to export the component and import it where it is used.
3) for the hard coded statements(code), make seperate file can be named as constants.js and while adding the urls or anything hardcoded, 
always declare them in CAPITAL LETTERS.

4) TWO TYPES OF EXPORT/IMPORT
- DEFAULT EXPORT/IMPORT - for one export/import
export default Component;
import Component from "path";

- NAMED EXPORT/IMPORT - if u want to export multiple things feom one file, use named export
export const Component;
import {Component} from "path";

QUESTION -
Can we use default export along with named export in a file.
