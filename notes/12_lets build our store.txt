REDUXðŸš€

1) Use of Redux is not mandatory.
2) use for handling state of the application.
3) applicatuon becomes easier to debug.

REDUX TOOLKIT(RTK)ðŸš€
- New and easier way of using redux.

Redux toolkit(redux)ðŸš€
It is a whole big JS object which can be directly accessed by any components from anywhere.
It okay to store all the data inside one object, but for easy understanding, we logically divide the object into pieces called slices.
eg - cart slice, user slice, etc.

We cannot directly modify the slices.

Trying to make the cart working - i.e, when we click on the item to add it to the cart, it will add that item to the cart to procedd to buy.
For eg, if we want to modify the cart slice, by clicking on the add button.

PROCESS FOLLOWED WHILE ADDING (WRITE) DATA TO A SLICEðŸš€
- When we click on the add button, 
it "DISPATCHES AN ACTION, THAT ACTION WILL CALL A FUNCTION AND THIS FUNCTION WILL INTERNALLY MODIFIES THAT CART(SLICE)".
- This function is called as "REDUCER"

PROPER DEFINATION -> When u press the add button, it dispatches an action, which calls a reducer function which updates/modifies the slice of the redux store.

ADD -----> A------> fn() ------> CART
        Dispatch    Reducer        Slice
        (ACTION)

PROCESS FOLLOWED WHILE READING DATA TO A SLICEðŸš€
- SELECTOR is used to read data from the redux store.
- And this phenomenon is known as "SUBSCRIBING TO THE STORE".
- SELECTOR will read the data and return it to the component.

- Let say whenever we add anything to the cart, the cart icon in the header should display no of items in the cart automatically.
- so it will read the data from the store.
- so we can say that Header compenent is "subscribed to the store" using a "selector".
