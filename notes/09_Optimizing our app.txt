Single Responsibility PrincipleðŸš€ -

Single Responsibility Principle means each component should have only one responsibility to do.
Means components are functions only. so each function should have only one job to perform.

It should be modular. Modular means same that each function should perform only one job.
- It helps to make the code more maintainable, testable and reusable.
 - You can reuse the components like restaurent cards.
 - If an error occurs, u will be easily able to understand where the error is (which component is throwing error). Can easily be tested. 

Custom HooksðŸš€

Hooks are utility functions.
Custom hooks means we can create our own hooks.

For example, we can make custom hooks for separating the API calls from the components. 
So that components will have only one job i.e, just to display the components.
