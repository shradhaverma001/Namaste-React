- In CSS,
if u want space between two divs(one towards left and other towards right) present in main div, use 
justify-content: space-between;  => property

if u want to display list items in one line instead of in points form, use
display : flex;

if u want to remove points from the list, use
list-style-type: none;

if u want to replicate cards not only in one line but below that also, use
flex-wrap: wrap;

for adding hover css, use
.className:hover {
    cursor: pointer;
    border: 1px solid black;
}

React props - these are properties. It creats a object which can be passed to component.
Suppose u want to replicate (reuse) some functional component. So props are arguments that are passed to functional component(similar to arguments in function).

INDUSTRIAL LINGUALS
- destructuring on the fly - when we destruce the props and write the props separately. as a JS object.
{{rename, cuisine}}

- config driven UI (helpful in System Design Interview)
It means UI is driven by config(data). Suppose u are in delhi, so food restaurents will be shown of delhi if in dehradun, so restaurents options will be of dehradun
This means UI is getting changed according to data


READ ABOUT OPTIONAL CHAINING

=> VERY IMPORTANT
WHY DO WE NEED KEYS?
Keys -> render
-> React says that don't use index as keys - its bad practise- if the order of items may change
