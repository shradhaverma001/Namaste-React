HIGHER ORDER COMPONENTSðŸš€
Higher order components are the JS functions which takes a component as an input, then enhance that component and returns
the enhanced component as an output.

EXAMPLE-
we see some restaurants cards having promoted label in swiggy. So will create that feature using higher order component.

higher order component does not change/modify the component, it just enhances/ add more features to the component.

CONTROLLED AND UNCONTROLLED COMPONENTSðŸš€
