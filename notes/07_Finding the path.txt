IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT useEffect()ðŸš€

1) It takes 2 arguments one is callback function, other is dependency array.
2) dependency array parameter is not mandatory.
CASES -
CASE 1 - 
if we don't provide 2nd argement, that is dependency array, then the useEffect callback function will run everytime the component is rendered.
i.e, if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render.
CASE 2-
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render(just once).
CASE 3 -
if dependency array contains something(variable, i.e, dependency), then => useEffect is called everytime that dependency(variable) is updated.

INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR useState()ðŸš€
- Never use hooks outside of the functional component.
- Always define hooks on the top of the components.
- never use hooks inside if conditions or for loops etc.

ROUTERSðŸš€
install router from react -
command - npm i react-router-dom

import createBrowserRouter and RouterProvider from this library.
createBrowserRouter is used to create the configuration .
RouterProvider is used to render that configuration in the root.

Outlet component by react domðŸš€
When u want to create the children routes, to render that routes accordingly, we use Outlet component.
When we change the routes the outlet will be replaced by that component.
And user can't even see that we have use outlet in the onspect window as well. Because it is replaced be the component.

FOR FIXED HEADERS AND FOOTERSðŸš€
U can embed the other child components into the main component where header is present.

FOR CHILDREN ROUTESðŸš€

LINK COMPONENTðŸš€
The component is provided by react-router-dom.
This is a powerful component which prevents the whole page from reloading while we are going to different page(changing routes like about, contact).
This makes the react app faster.

SINGLE PAGE APPLICATIONðŸš€
This phenomenon in which we are just loading that particular content and not the whole page makes the application as single page application.
React applications are known as single page application.
whole application work inside a component. and all other things are just interchanging components(routes, pages).

Proper defination- In single page application, network call is made only once as all the components gets loaded at that time via client side routing.

2 TYPES OF ROUTINGðŸš€
1) CLIENT SIDE ROUTING -
    It means network call is made only once, and all the components gets loaded at that time. and when we are changing the routes, we are just interchanging the components.

2) SERVER SIDE ROUTING -
    It means whenever we are changing the routes, each time we are making network calls to the server and it will reloads the page.

ANOTHER SUPERPOWER (HOOK) TO READ PARAMETERS FROM THE URL (API CALL)
useParams()ðŸš€ - 
This is provided by react-router-dom

THREE IMPORTANT ROUTES TO KEEP IN MINDðŸš€
1) createBrowserRouter - use to create the routes - create router configuration.
2) RouterProvider - use to provide router connectivity with the createBrowserRouter.
3) useRouteError - use to read error message from the browser console and make our own custom error page.

LINK component is a wrapper over the anchor tag.
If u check in browser console, wherever we have used link component, in console, it will Always be a anchor tag. 
Its because link internally uses anchor tag, itself. only diff is it keeps track of the parent component and does not reload the page.
