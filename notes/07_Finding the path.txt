IMPORTANT THINGS ABOUT useEffect()ðŸš€

1) It takes 2 arguments one is callback function, other is dependency array.
2) dependency array parameter is not mandatory.
CASES -
CASE 1 - 
if we don't provide 2nd argement, that is dependency array, then the useEffect callback function will run everytime the component is rendered.
i.e, if no dependency array => useEffect is called on every render.
CASE 2-
if dependency array is empty = [] => useEffect is called on initial render(just once).
CASE 3 -
if dependency array contains something(variable, i.e, dependency), then => useEffect is called everytime that dependency(variable) is updated.

INDUSTRY PRACTICES FOR useState()ðŸš€
- Never use hooks outside of the functional component.
- Always define hooks on the top of the components.
- never use hooks inside if conditions or for loops etc.

ROUTERSðŸš€
install router from react -
command - npm i react-router-dom

import createBrowserRouter and RouterProvider from this library.
createBrowserRouter is used to create the configuration .
RouterProvider is used to render that configuration in the root.

Outlet component by react domðŸš€
When u want to create the children routes, to render that routes accordingly, we use Outlet component.
When we change the routes the outlet will be replaced by that component.
And user can't even see that we have use outlet in the onspect window as well. Because it is replaced be the component.
